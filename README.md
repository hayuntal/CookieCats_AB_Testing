    "## Overview\n",
    "This project evaluates two different level gate designs in a mobile game to determine which one enhances player retention and engagement more effectively. The control group encounters a game gate at level 30, whereas the test group encounters it at level 40. Our goal is to assess which strategy leads to higher retention rates after one week of installation."
